### A piano with a built-in rhythm game! 
This was a project for New York University's prototyping design class (EG1003) for spring of 2018. The design won the Nick Russo Award and the I2E Award for Innovation.  

| Implemented | - Automatic conversion of midi files to playable songs<br>- Real time playback<br>- Pseudo-random color change for differentiating notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unimplemented | - Tempo must be input manually (bpm variable in code)<br>- The circuit board for the buttons failed, so input recording and scoring was not able to be tested<br>- As such the menu with scrolling text is not used in the last release and songs must be set beforehand in-code |
